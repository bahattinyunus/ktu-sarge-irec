# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, this repository is for **Teknofest 2026** planning and documentation. Code security is not the primary concern as there is no active software product yet.

| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |
